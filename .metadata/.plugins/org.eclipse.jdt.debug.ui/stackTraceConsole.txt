io.cucumber.junit.UndefinedStepException: The step "i hover mouse on admin" is undefined. You can implement it using the snippet(s) below:

@When("i hover mouse on admin")
public void i_hover_mouse_on_admin() {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();
}


Some other steps were also undefined:

@Then("the suboptions should be displayed")
public void the_suboptions_should_be_displayed() {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();
}
